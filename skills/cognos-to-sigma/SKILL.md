# Cognos → Sigma migration

Convert a Cognos **Data Module** into a Sigma **data model**, then convert the Cognos
**report** that sits on it into a matching Sigma **workbook**. Translate what maps
cleanly; **flag what doesn't** (runtime macros, running-totals, localization) instead
of emitting wrong logic.

> Read `refs/` before relying on shapes: `design-notes.md` (translation surface + scope),
> `data-module-shape.md` + `report-spec-shape.md` (the real CA JSON/XML structures),
> `expression-dsl.md` (the Cognos-expression → Sigma-formula mapping table).
> For the canonical Sigma data-model + workbook spec shapes, defer to the companion
> `sigma-data-models` / `sigma-workbooks` skills.

## Prerequisites

- **Cognos Analytics 11.1+** REST access (on-prem or CA on Cloud). Base path is
  `<host>/bi/v1` (NOT `/api/v1`). Auth = a logged-in session: a **session cookie** +
  the **`X-XSRF-Token`** header. On IBMid-SSO trials you can't log in headlessly —
  grab a live session from the browser (DevTools → Network → any `coreBundle.js`-initiated
  `bi/v1/...` XHR → **Copy as cURL**) and capture it with `scripts/get-cognos-session.sh`
  (paste the **whole** Cookie header — incl. the Akamai `_abck`/`bm_sz`/`bm_sv`/`ak_bmsc`
  cookies, or the WAF returns 441). CAoC sessions are short-lived: an `HTTP 441` means
  re-login + re-copy. The **durable** path for a real engagement is a CA API key/service
  credential where the tenant allows it — prefer it over session replay.
- **Sigma** API token (via the `sigma-api` skill) to POST the data model + workbook.
- **Node** for the converter (`converter/`: `npm install` once).

---

## Phase 0 — Discover (CA REST)

```bash
export COGNOS_BASE="https://<host>/bi/v1"
export COGNOS_COOKIE="<cookie string>"   export COGNOS_XSRF="<x-xsrf-token>"
scripts/cognos-discover.sh list   <folderId>          # list a folder's items
scripts/cognos-discover.sh module <moduleId> > m.json # Data Module JSON
scripts/cognos-discover.sh report <reportId> > r.xml  # report-spec XML
```

- Samples folder, modules, and reports are discovered by walking `GET /objects/{id}/items`.
- **Data Module spec**: `GET /bi/v1/metadata/modules/{id}` (NOT `/modules/{id}`, which is empty).
- **Report spec**: `GET /bi/v1/objects/{id}?fields=specification` → the `specification` string is the report XML.
- Prefer **warehouse-backed** modules (built on a Data server connection) over file-backed
  ones — they carry complete schemas. File-backed modules (uploaded `.xlsx`) are a
  *land-in-warehouse-first* case (see Verify/parity).

## Phase 1 — Convert the Data Module → Sigma data model

```bash
cd converter && npm install
node --import tsx/esm cli.ts ../path/to/module.json --connection <SIGMA_CONN> --database <DB> --schema <SCHEMA>
```
Emits the Sigma data-model JSON on stdout; stats + warnings on stderr. Read the
warnings aloud to the user — they are the parts that need manual authoring
(running-totals, cross-element metrics, FIXED-LOD-style calcs, localization).

## Phase 2 — POST the data model + read back ids (hard gate)

```bash
eval "$(scripts/get-token.sh)"                 # Sigma SIGMA_BASE_URL + SIGMA_API_TOKEN
node scripts/post-and-readback.mjs --type datamodel --spec dm.json \
  --folder <folderId> --out dm-map.json
```
POSTs to `/v2/dataModels/spec`, reads the spec back, and **fails on any `type=error`
column** (a spec can POST 200 yet have formulas that don't resolve at query time — the
readback scan is what catches it; it checks every element incl. the derived view).
`dm-map.json` carries the real `dataModelId` + element ids (Sigma reassigns them on POST).
Do not proceed past a non-zero exit.

## Phase 3 — Convert the report → Sigma workbook, wired to the DM

```bash
node --import tsx/esm cli.ts ../path/to/report.xml --dm <dataModelId> > wb.json
node scripts/remap-wb-to-dm-ids.mjs --wb wb.json --dm-id <dataModelId> --out wb.remapped.json
node scripts/post-and-readback.mjs --type workbook --spec wb.remapped.json --folder <folderId>
node scripts/apply-layout.mjs --workbook <workbookId>          # clean dashboard grid
```
Each Cognos **list/crosstab/chart/map** becomes the matching Sigma element sourced from
the migrated DM element. The converter emits each element's `source.elementId` as the
query **subject name** (a placeholder) — `remap-wb-to-dm-ids.mjs` rewrites those to the
real ids from Phase 2's readback (matched by element name). Then post-and-readback POSTs
the workbook and re-runs the error-column gate. **`apply-layout.mjs` then gives the page a
clean 24-col grid** (controls on top, content stacked full-width with per-kind heights) —
Sigma auto-arrange otherwise squishes every element to the same height. It writes the
top-level `spec.layout` XML (matched to readback ids) and confirms it survives readback.

## Phase 4 — Verify parity (hard gate — the real proof)

```bash
node scripts/assert-parity.mjs --plan --type workbook --id <workbookId>   # emits per-element SQL
# run each via mcp-v2 query (or the Sigma query API), save totals to actual.json
node scripts/assert-parity.mjs --check --actual actual.json --expected cognos.json --tol 0.01
```
A migration is **GREEN only when** (a) `assert-parity --check` passes AND (b) the workbook
came back with a clean layout (`apply-layout.mjs` reported `layoutOnReadback: true`) — never
on a 200 POST alone. Layout cleanliness is part of parity: matching numbers on a squished,
auto-stacked dashboard isn't a faithful migration.
`cognos.json` = the numbers from the Cognos report (or the source warehouse). For real
parity, land the Cognos source DB in the warehouse Sigma reads (the GO samples are the
canonical IBM `GOSALES`/`GOSALESDW` DBs — published, loadable), then confirm the Cognos
report's numbers match the migrated Sigma workbook to the cent.

## What's flagged, never faked

The converter emits a warning (and a readable placeholder) instead of wrong logic for:
runtime **macros** (`#…# prompt(…,'token',…)` — dynamic column/SQL building, e.g. a
"swap measure" picker → model as a control + `Switch`), **running-total / moving-* /
rank / lag / lead** (window funcs with no clean single-column analog), **GetResourceString**
(localization), composite/non-equi **joins**, and **detail/summary filters** (surfaced
to re-create as Sigma filters). **Crosstabs → Sigma pivot-tables** (rows/columns edges →
rowsBy/columnsBy, measure → values) and **charts (RAVE2 `<vizControl>`) → Sigma chart elements**
(bar/column/line/area/pie/donut/combo/scatter via the slot model — see `refs/format-shapes.md`)
and **maps (`tiledmap`) → Sigma region-map / point-map** ARE converted and live-validated.
Only Cognos viz types with no native Sigma element (network, word-cloud, packed-bubble, treemap)
fall back to a flagged table. Drill-through→actions and Framework Manager `.cpf` remain roadmap.

## Gap scout — close a flagged expression

For a flagged expression you want to actually resolve (a runtime macro, running-total /
rank / lag-lead, `GetResourceString`, a nested CASE, an unmapped function), spawn the
**gap-scout subagent** (`scripts/gap-scout.md`): it proposes a Sigma formula, validates it
against the customer's live Sigma via `scripts/scout-validate-and-persist.mjs`, and on
success persists the rule to `~/.cognos-to-sigma/learned-rules.json` — which the converter
CLI auto-applies *before* the built-in translator on the next run. If no formula validates,
it returns an opt-in `scripts/escalate-gap.py` command to file a tracking issue (ask first).
